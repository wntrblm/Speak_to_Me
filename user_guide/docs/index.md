## Warranty, disclaimers, and limits

Modules purchased from Winterbloom have a warranty of six months from the date of purchase. This warranty covers any manufacturing defects in the module. It does not cover damage from due to incorrect handling, storage, or power, overvoltage events, or modifications.

Please [contact us](mailto:support@winterbloom.com) if you are experiencing issues with your module. Modules returned under warranty will either be refunded, replaced, or repaired at our discretion. You will be responsible for the cost of returning the module to Winterbloom.

Because Eurorack has a vast number of possible combinations of power supplies, modules, cases, and accessories, it is impossible for us to guarantee compatibility with every possible configuration. We make a reasonable effort to test modules with several power supplies, cases, and other modules.

We encourage tinkering, however, we will not refund, repair, or replace any products that have been modified.

We have stress tested Speak to Me under the following conditions. These are provided for reference only; we do not guarantee that that the module will function under these conditions.

* Continuous run time: at least 48 hours
* Overvoltage from power supply: at least `±18 volts`
* Reverse voltage from power supply: at least `±18 volts`
* Undervoltage from power supply: as low as `±8 volts`
* Over and under voltage on inputs: at least `±12 volts`
* Outputs shorted to ground: at least 60 minutes


## Acknowledgments and thanks

Speak to Me would not be possible without the support of Winterbloom's incredible community, the Trans Synth Discord, and Noise Engineering.
